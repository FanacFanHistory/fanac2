New infrastructure development for www.fanac.org

## History
The FANAC Fan History Project is sponsored by the Florida Association for Nucleation and Conventions (F.A.N.A.C.), Inc. which was the organization behind MagiCon, the 50th World Science Fiction Convention in Orlando, Florida in 1992. We organized FANAC in 1987 to bid for and run the 50th Worldcon. The Fan History Project has been running for nearly 25 years, since 1994. The FANAC.ORG website was started in 1996.

The FANAC Fan History Project is devoted to the preservation and distribution of information about science fiction and science fiction fandom. On this website, you might find copies of your favorite old fanzine, pictures of Walt Willis playing Ghoodminton in Ireland or Harlan Ellison by the pool at the convention that inspired the writing of the filk song "Bouncing Potatoes", and the lyrics to the song as well. You'll find important articles, histories, and references about fandom. We catalog and provide access to material about Worldcons and other conventions, fanzines, clubs, photos, fannish references, Fan Funds, and just about anything else relate to science fiction fandom and its past. You can find information about today's fandom too, because that's tomorrow's past.

We are the archive of fandom.

## Project
The website is mostly static HTML pages and images. The images are scanned by volunteers or sent in by contributors. The HTML pages are generated from metadata files by a set of scripts. The scripts are written in REXX, a powerful scripting language similar to Javascript (although predating the web by a decade). 

The purpose of this project is to update the infrastructure. The new scripts will be in Python. We will use standard open source software modules such as template engines to replace custom code. The new metadata files will be in JSON format. We will use unit tests to ensure correctness. Further down the road, but very high in priority, will be providing human-friendly permalinks and robot-friendly web APIs.
